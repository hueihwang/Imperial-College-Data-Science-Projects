1. Data are raw facts that have no meaning on itself. E.g. "Huei Hwang", "25", and "Lightning" are raw data that have no meaning until they are organised logically.
2. Field is a single category of data. E.g. in database of students: "Name", "Age" and "Score" are fields
3. Record are a collection of related fields that describe a single entity. E.g. in a student database, a record can be: Name: Huei Hwang, Age: 25, Score: 90
4. Files are a collection of related records. E.g. in a student database, a file can be a collection of records of students

DBMS

DBMS is Database Management System. It is a software that is used to manage databases. It provides an interface for users to interact with the database. It also provides a way to store and retrieve data from the database. It also provides a way to manage the database, such as creating, updating, and deleting data.

Advantages of DBMS
1. Better data sharing - Many users can access the database simultaneously
2. Data integration - It can improve the integration of data and ensure all users see the same, live updated data
3. Data security - It can provide better security for data, such as encryption and access control
4. Data consistency - It can ensure that data is consistent and accurate

Differences between Data and Information
1. Data is raw facts that have no meaning on itself. Information is data that has been processed and organised to have meaning
2. Data is unprocessed, while information is processed
3. Data is the input, while information is the output

What is Metadata

Metadata is data that describes other data. It describes the structure and properties of data. E.g. in a database, metadata can include:
1. The names of the tables and fields
2. The data types of the fields
3. The relationships between tables
4. The constraints on the data

e) How many records does the file contain?
4 Records

f) How many fields are there per record?
5 Fields (Project Code, Project Manager, Manager Phone, Manager Address, Project Bid Price)
